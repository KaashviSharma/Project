    <p>Hello! My name is Kaashvi.I am 10 year old and study in 5th standard.My hobbies are drawing and reading.I like reading story books specially the thrillers.My hobby is not very expensive,we can borrow books from libraries and return them later.One can never feel lonely in the company of books.Books are the store house of knowledge and entertainment.We can enjoy the company of great writers through their work.Books keep one busy and happy.My favourite books are Every Dog Has it`s own TALE and Harry Potter.Elders like to read newspapers and magzines while children like story books and journals.Reading helps you to build imagination and who knows that you might start writing books yourself!</p>
